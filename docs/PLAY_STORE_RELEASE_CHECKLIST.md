## ‚ö†Ô∏è ACTION REQUIRED - MUST COMPLETE

### 1. Generate Upload Keystore (CRITICAL)
```bash
# Run this command in your terminal:
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/upload-keystore.jks -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload

# When prompted, enter:
# - Password (remember this!)
# - Your name
# - Organization: Your company or personal name
# - City, State, Country
```

**Then update `/android/key.properties` with:**
```properties
storePassword=YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE
keyPassword=YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE
keyAlias=upload
storeFile=/Users/noelpinto/upload-keystore.jks
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: 
- Keep `upload-keystore.jks` file safe - if you lose it, you can NEVER update your app!
- Backup the keystore to a secure location (password manager, encrypted cloud storage)

---

### 2. Host Privacy Policy Online (REQUIRED)
